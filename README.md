# RecycleVision--Garbage-Image-Classification-Using-DL
This project focuses on classifying garbage/waste images into 10 categories using deep learning.
I trained and compared multiple CNN-based transfer learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogLeNet, VGG16) and deployed the best one (ResNet50) using Streamlit.
